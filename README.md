Project done with Yuhan Yang, Yudi Tan, and Janaki Vivrekar for graduate virtual reality project.

Web-based painter, designed to be viewed with Google Cardboard / VR on a mobile device (with results mirrored on the computer screen), testing the use of binocular rivalry to create "4-dimensional"/tetrachromatic color experiences.

Painting interface built using P5.js; hyperspectral colors selected via consulting with users (particularly artists); backend functionality built with Javascript.
